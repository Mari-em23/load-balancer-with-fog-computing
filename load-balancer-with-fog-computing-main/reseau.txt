Bien sûr ! Voici une explication claire :

1️⃣ Binary numbers (binaire)

Basés sur les puissances de 2 : chaque position représente 2⁰, 2¹, 2², etc.

Deux états possibles seulement : 0 ou 1 (off/on).

Exemple : 1011 en binaire = (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (1×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 en décimal.

2️⃣ Decimal numbers (décimal)

Basés sur les puissances de 10 : chaque position représente 10⁰, 10¹, 10², etc.

10 chiffres possibles : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Exemple : 237 en décimal = (2×10²) + (3×10¹) + (7×10⁰) = 200 + 30 + 7.

✅ Donc les différences principales sont :

Le système de numération (base 2 vs base 10).

Le nombre de chiffres possibles (2 chiffres pour binaire, 10 pour décimal).



Convert 10111010 (binary) to hexadecimal:

Split into 2 groups of 4 bits:

1011 → B

1010 → A

Combine them: BA  



An IPv6 hextet (like 10CD) is made of 4 hexadecimal digits.

Each hexadecimal digit = 4 bits
So:
4 hex digits × 4 bits = 16 bits

✅ Correct answer: 16

A runt frame is an Ethernet frame that is smaller than the minimum allowed size (less than 64 bytes).

✅ What happens: The frame is dropped.


Subnet mask: 255.255.252.0 → /22 → 32 - 22 = 10 host bits


Devices on the same subnet will share the same network number, subnet mask, and default gateway. The default gateway is the IPv4
address of the Layer 3 device that allows the devices on the same subnet to communicate with other networks.

IP addresses contain two parts. One part identifies the network portion. The network portion of the IP address will be the same
for all hosts connected to the same local network. The second part of the IP address identifies the individual host on that
network. Both the physical MAC and logical IP addresses are required for a computer to communicate on a hierarchical
network.

The Network and Sharing Center on a PC shows your basic network information and set up connections, including your active
networks and whether you are connected wired or wirelessly to the internet and within your LAN. You can view the properties of
your connections here.

On an Ethernet network, the host MAC address is similar to a person's name. A MAC address indicates the individual identity of
a specific host, but it does not indicate where on the network the host is located. If all hosts on the internet (millions and millions
of them) were each identified by their unique MAC address only, imagine how difficult it would be to locate a single one. It is
better to divide larger networks into smaller, more manageable pieces. One way to divide larger networks is to use a
hierarchical design model.

Hierarchical networks scale well. The access layer provides a connection point for end user devices to the network and allows
multiple hosts to connect to other hosts through a network device, usually a switch or a wireless access point. Typically, all
devices within a single access layer will have the same network portion of the IP address. The distribution layer provides a
connection point for separate networks and controls the flow of information between the networks. Distribution layer devices
control the type and amount of traffic that flows from the access layer to the core layer. The core layer is a high-speed
backbone layer with redundant connections. It is responsible for transporting large amounts of data between multiple end
networks. The main goal of the core layer is to transport data quickly.
